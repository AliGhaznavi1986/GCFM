# This script is written by Matlab 2015 
This project is about gender classification framework by using facial and and also other external features like hair and clothing instead of hole face. I consider facial components include forehead, eyes, nose, mouth and chin. This system designed based on feature extraction methods for hair and clothing by using Mamdani fuzzy method for gender classification. The major contributions of this script are investigating the gender discriminating ability of clothing information; using facial components instead of the whole face to obtain higher robustness for occlusions and noise and exploiting hair and clothing information to facilitate gender classification.
